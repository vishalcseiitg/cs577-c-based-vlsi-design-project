For your CS577 Mid-Term Project Evaluation, you have been assigned to work on the cryto_kem_dec of kyber768. I will be your TA-mentor for the Project. Please contact me if you have any doubts about your project. 

The deliverables for your Pre Mid-Term Evaluation are as follows:
You will have to download the zip folder from link.
Inside the folder, you must identify the function crypto_kem_dec(assigned to you). This will be your top function.
You must make modifications inside this function to make it synthesizable by HLS.
You have to run the C simulation and RTL-Co-Simultation for it as well.
Write all the modifications you made to the code to make it synthesizable and how the modifications affected the parameters into a document (a paragraph). You have to submit this document during evaluation.
Please note the parameters like LUTs FFs Latency etc. which we'll ask you to enter into a form during evaluation. During the evaluation, your assigned TA will look for all five deliverables.
